Deep Learning Projects


In this project, I trained my model with Pytorch and got the 13% accuracy rate. 

And then, I implemented transfer learning by using resnet152 an fincreasd the accuracy rate to 78%.

My code also categorize the human image as dod breed. Having large classsified data (133 dog breed) drops my acuracy rate.

Few examples are below:
